🚀 My Professional Portfolio: Foundational Web Development
This repository hosts my personal web development portfolio, a showcase of my skills, best projects, and commitment to clean, efficient code.

**💡 The Tech Stack**
This portfolio is built from scratch using only the foundational building blocks of the web:

HTML5: For semantic structure and content.

CSS3: For modern, responsive design and layout (including Flexbox and Grid).

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): For interactivity, DOM manipulation, and dynamic user experiences—no large external frameworks or libraries are used.

**✨ Key Features**
Responsive Design: Optimized for a seamless experience across all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

Clean Codebase: Focus on readability, maintenance, and adherence to modern coding standards.

Project Showcase: Demos and links to my most significant projects, highlighting my problem-solving abilities.

Performance Focused: Lightweight and fast loading, utilizing pure code without unnecessary bloat.
